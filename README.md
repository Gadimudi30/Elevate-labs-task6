"This task focuses on analyzing monthly sales trends using order data. By grouping sales by year and month, we can calculate the total revenue and count how many orders were made each month. This helps identify patterns like busy or slow periods in sales. Sorting the results by date,shows how sales change over time. We can also limit the analysis to specific time frames for more targeted insights. Overall, it helps businesses understand their sales performance month by month."
